# Polytechnic-Playing-Machine-PPM

Polytechnic Playing Machine (PPM) project is to design and to implement a hexadecimal number replacement game. My team performed a core-based design on the Xilinx FPGA board and implemented a sophisticated machine player strategy to playing against human. Our design involves using schematics and hardware descriptive language. 

My responsibility in the team includes designing complex decision tree, implementing part of the machine strategies, and debugging the prototype.
